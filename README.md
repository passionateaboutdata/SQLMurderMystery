# SQLMurderMystery
There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime.

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.


You can solve the mystery on their website (http://mystery.knightlab.com/) itself or download it from the github repository (https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries) and solve it in your preferred method. 

I have used SQL. SQL + Murder Mystery what's not to love!!
